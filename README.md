Test webhook for LAC
This is a test webhook for LAC.
If you don't know what LAC is:

You ever have that moment when you feel so sad about a character in, whatever, and you wish you could just hop in to the screen and give them a big hug?
Oh my goodness, that's what i've been wanting to do for so long. It's not stupid, though.
It's BFDI, and how it's always a Tear Jerker. I especially feel bad for Leafy. I mean, would you not want to just help her out when you hear this:
Leafy, as of BFDIA, was practically exiled, and has to live with being seen as basically a monster for the rest of her life, being trapped in Yoyleland. Not to mention that, despite a seemingly aggressive outward appearance towards other contestants, she seems to still care about them, given she backed away at Coiny's "deep fried breaths" in IDFB 1. But she wasn't even able to say a word in preventing this, just out of fear of what'd happen to her. And if you really think about that'd feel, being unable to help old friends that you still care about because they hate you...

Goodness, Leafy, I almost feel as bad for you instead of Bubble.
Actually, I feel WAY more bad.
BFDI is great and all,
but don't you wish YOU were a contestant,
who could help anyone in need...
at just the right time?
Then go to the LAC.
